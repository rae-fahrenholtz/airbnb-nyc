# Airbnb Prices in New York City

## Outline
For the first capstone project of the Thinkful Data Science program, this analysis conducts a business research proposal utilizing statistical hypothesis testing, such as A/B testing. 

## Data
I used data on Airbnb prices in New York City in 2019. I utilized this data set from Kaggle, found [here](www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data), which initially came from a public Airbnb API.

## Business Proposal
Some features of interest include prices, room type, and neighborhood groups. The goal of this business analysis is that with these results, a potential traveler will be able to make quick rental decisions given their budget and need for proximity to downtown.
